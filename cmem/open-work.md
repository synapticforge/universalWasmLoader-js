# Open work — universal-wasm-loader

Re-derived 2026-10-12, after the 1.1.0 release. Details live in the linked files; this file only
lists what is still open. Close an item by striking it here with the commit that closed it.

## Dated

- ✅ **Node 26** (LTS on 2026-10-28): installed in fnm (26.11.1) and measured 2026-10-12: suite
  24/24, `compat.ts`, the gate self-test and `how-to-use.js` all pass. CI leg added the same day.
  `bun run lts` adds it by itself on 2026-10-28 (it reads Node's schedule). Remaining on that
  date: confirm `bun run lts` shows 3 lines.
- ✅ **`deno lint` replaced, 2026-10-13** (owner: "Biome has better backing. We will use that."):
  `tsc` with `checkJs` + lint-like flags, then Biome 2.5.15 with deno lint's recommended rules
  mapped (56 in Biome's preset, 5 opted in, 2 dropped). [linting.md](linting.md). Tell binaryang
  (it has not chosen a linter) — hand-over below.
- **Found by `checkJs`, fixed 2026-10-13:** a string-param import or a WASI call that arrives
  while `memRef.current` is still `null` (a module with no exported `memory`, or a call from its
  start function) crashed with a bare `TypeError` on `null`; it now throws an `Error` naming the
  import and the likely cause. Probed before/after; no other behaviour changed (surface floor:
  patch).
- ✅ **No `@std` dependency (2026-10-21, owner: "I would rather not depend on any @std features
  that may disappear with deno")**: the tests use `node:assert/strict`; `@std/assert` and `.npmrc`
  (its JSR registry line) removed; the compatibility gate stands in for `@std/assert` when it runs
  1.1.0's / 1.1.1's tests ([compat-gate.md](compat-gate.md)). What still needs Deno: `deno publish`
  (below) and `regen-fixtures.ts` (wasmtk is a Deno project); Deno stays a TESTED runtime for users.
- **Publishing still needs Deno** (`deno publish`, F2 of binaryang's exit guide). By design; JSR's
  to solve before ~2027-10. Re-check when JSR ships a non-Deno publisher that keeps provenance.

## The move to the `synapticforge1` organization (by 2026-10-21)

- ✅ **First CI run in the new organization**: run 39690350614 on `23aa737` (2026-10-21), all seven
  jobs green, the new `npm:prove` step in Gates included (its first run on CI).
- ✅ **The new organization's Actions policy** — owner, 2026-10-21: "it has the same policy as
  before, and is the same as was used with binaryang." The workflows stay `run:`-only (valid under
  any policy; [overview.md](overview.md) § Release flow).
- ✅ **Provenance from the new repo**: JSR 1.1.1, rekorLogId `3367515417` (2026-10-21).

## npm (owner, 2026-10-21: "setup an npm repository just as we did for binaryang")

- ✅ **npm is live and in step with JSR (2026-10-21).** 1.1.0 by hand; **1.1.1 by trusted
  publishing with provenance** (recovery dispatch run 39697206534), byte-identical to the tag, as
  on JSR. The README has the npm route. One run now publishes both (`verify` → `jsr` ∥ `npm` →
  `release`, no on/off switch). The way there (a secret instead of a variable; the trusted
  publisher never saved, found by `npm trust list`): [npm.md](npm.md).
- ⬜ **The next tag push is the first full run of the one-run design**; check both read-backs
  (JSR `rekorLogId`, npm attestation) and that `release` waited for both.

## Unmeasured

- **Browser RUN — measured once by hand 2026-10-26, not yet a gate.** The unbundled
  `tests/loader.test.js` ran in headless **Chrome 156 and Edge 156**: an import map pointed
  `node:test` / `node:assert/strict` at two small shims, a local http server served the repo, and
  every fixture was fetched over http (`.wasm` as `application/wasm`): **24/24 in both**. Inverted:
  `math_50.wasm` answering 404 → exactly its 8 tests failed. Same day: Bun 1.4.4 24/24, Node
  22.23.3 / 24.21.0 / 26.12.0 24/24 each, Deno 2.9.8 24/24 steps. The harness was a one-time
  scratchpad script (it used `import.meta.dir`, Bun-only); committing it as `bun run browser:run`
  on `node:` builtins would make this a gate (same gap in binaryang). Firefox / Safari: UNMEASURED.
- 🔴 **Found by that inversion, NOT fixed (2026-10-26): an HTTP error on the `.wasm` is masked.**
  `universal-wasm-loader.js:75-86`: `instantiateStreaming` failures are swallowed by
  `catch (_e) {}`, then a second `fetch` reads the 404 body without checking `res.ok`, so the
  user sees `WebAssembly.instantiate(): BufferSource argument is empty` instead of "HTTP 404 for
  <url>". The same catch also hides a real link/compile error behind a second download. Fix: check
  `response.ok` (throw naming the URL and status) before both paths; keep the fallback only for a
  wrong `Content-Type`. Behaviour of successful loads unchanged → surface floor patch; needs a test
  (an http fixture server, or a `fetch` stub). Applies to every runtime that loads an http(s) URL.

## Workspace letters (`../../cmem/handoffs.md`)

- ✅ **H6 (every repo), DONE 2026-10-12 on branch `h6`** (owner: "lets implement the H6 item"):
  SemVer was already met; the ★ block `4048256` ([best-practices.md](best-practices.md)); the
  compatibility gate `f3da283` ([compat-gate.md](compat-gate.md)); the memory layout (`CLAUDE.md`
  → pointer, [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md), [working-rules.md](working-rules.md),
  `.gitattributes` LF pin) in the commit after. The workspace letter closes when the owner closes it.
  Not done: Rule 3's CONSUMER half — no known consumer runs a suite ([compat-gate.md](compat-gate.md)).
- **H7 (all loaders)** — this repo's part DONE 2026-10-12 on branch `h7`: the reference set is
  regenerated from wasmtk `f50c8e4` and stamped (`tests/fixtures.json`, `bun run fixtures`;
  [fixtures.md](fixtures.md)). L1–L8 are all other ports' items (none names -js). ✅ **Re-stamped
  2026-10-26** from the pushed post-purge twin `4a5c3cf668d` (`synapticforge1/wasmtk`), bytes
  unchanged (drift X8, ledger C11); the nine ports may copy the set now (hand-over table in
  [fixtures.md](fixtures.md)).
- ✅ **Workspace letters pulled 2026-10-26** (owner: "fix the open items, then make notations
  for the workspace to verify"), on branch `workspace-letters-2026-10-26`: H16 (`maintenance.strategy
  gc`, private note in `cmem/local/`), H17 part 3 (`VISION.md`, `regen-fixtures.ts`), H20 recorded
  ([overview.md](overview.md) § Where it lives), H22 / H25 (d) / H28 recorded
  ([working-rules.md](working-rules.md) § No secrets), H24 + C8 + H27 (★ re-copied and re-stamped,
  [best-practices.md](best-practices.md)), the pull line in `CLAUDE.md` now reads the workspace
  ledger first. Answers written to `../../cmem/workspace-correspondence.md`; the workspace closes.

## To hand over (not this repo's to fix)

- 🔴 **binaryang's releases can split the same way** (seen 2026-10-21): JSR latest **1.13.2**,
  npm only **1.13.1**. Its `publish.yml` runs `npm` after JSR, gated on `vars.NPM_PUBLISH`; a
  gate that is false skips npm silently. This repo's answer (one `verify` before either publish,
  no switch, a recovery dispatch): [npm.md](npm.md) § "The release path".

- 🔒 **binaryang and wasmtk switch to Biome too** (owner, 2026-10-13: "We are making the same
  switch for those projects also."). Their own sessions do it; this repo's
  [linting.md](linting.md) is the reference: the verified deno-lint → Biome rule map (and which 5
  rules to opt in), the linter-only config, and the `biome migrate` trap (`"preset": "none"`
  silently disables every rule — prove the rules fire on a probe file after any migration).

- 🔴 **wasmtk 2.0.3 on JSR builds wrong fixtures** (`f64` for `s32` in `math_50.wit`; every bool
  function fails; 9/24 red). Fixed at wasmtk HEAD `f50c8e4`, unreleased. [fixtures.md](fixtures.md).
- **The nine ports**: copy the stamped fixture set and fix their L-items; table in
  [fixtures.md](fixtures.md).

- **binaryang `scripts/check-browser.ts`**: Bun 1.4.3's browser target replaces a top-level
  `node:fs` import with an empty-object stub, so a bundle-only check passes code that breaks in a
  page. This repo's check adds a source scan ([bun-migration.md](bun-migration.md) § "Checks").
  Reported to the owner 2026-10-12.
- ✅ **`safe.directory`**: since 2026-10-26 the owner's SYSTEM config holds a wildcard for the
  whole workspace folder (ledger C9, closed); no per-command override is needed here.
